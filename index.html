    <h1>Digital Life Skills for Special Needs Children</h1>
    <p class="credit">Created by Dr. Arnab Chaudhuri</p>

    <h2>Why basic computer skills matter</h2>
    <p>
      We live in a technology‑driven world where education, work, communication, banking,
      and daily services increasingly depend on computers and the internet.    
      For children with special needs, learning basic computer skills such as typing and mouse use
      becomes an essential life skill, not just an academic or vocational add‑on.    
    </p>

    <h2>Typing and mouse use as core skills</h2>
    <p>
      Two foundational computer skills for children are typing on a keyboard and handling or clicking
      with a mouse or touchpad.    
      These skills allow the child to navigate learning platforms, write, communicate, and independently
      complete many everyday digital tasks.    
    </p>

    <h2>How computer skills support development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Literacy</strong>: Using educational software and word processors builds reading and writing skills,
        making computer literacy part of overall academic literacy.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication</strong>: For children with limited or no speech, computers and tablets can serve
        as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alternate writing</strong>: Typing offers an alternative way of written expression for children
        who find traditional handwriting difficult.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Attention</strong>: Working on a computer requires sustained attention and can strengthen
        focus and task persistence over time.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fine motor skills</strong>: Keyboard and mouse use help develop controlled finger and hand
        movements and hand–eye coordination.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensory regulation</strong>: The rhythmic feel and sound of typing can be regulating and enjoyable
        for some children with sensory needs.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Life skills</strong>: From ordering food to doing bank transactions, most daily activities now
        require basic computer or app skills.    
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vocational readiness</strong>: Early comfort with typing and navigating digital tools expands
        future job and training opportunities.    
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prerequisites before starting computer training</h2>
    <p>
      Before introducing a real keyboard and mouse, caregivers should check for basic readiness:
      sitting tolerance, ability to follow simple instructions, hand–eye coordination, fine and gross
      motor skills, and identification of alphabets and numbers.    
      Pre‑computer activities like using a dummy keyboard, matching letters and numbers, and
      practising up/down and right/left concepts make later computer learning smoother and less
      frustrating.    
    </p>

    <h2>About this training website</h2>
    <p>
      This website provides a structured three‑month, day‑by‑day training plan that helps caregivers
      teach typing and basic computer use to children with special needs in a gentle, stepwise manner.    
      The plan builds from pre‑computer skills to letters, favourite words, CVC words, special keys, sentences,
      and short paragraphs, with a focus on fun, consistency, and emotional safety.
