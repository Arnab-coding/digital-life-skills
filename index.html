    <h1>Digital Life Skills for Special Needs Children</h1>
    <p class="credit">Created by Dr. Arnab Chaudhuri</p>

    <h2>Why basic computer skills matter</h2>
    <p>
      We live in a technology‑driven world where education, work, communication, banking,
      and daily services increasingly depend on computers and the internet.[page:0]
      For children with special needs, learning basic computer skills such as typing and mouse use
      becomes an essential life skill, not just an academic or vocational add‑on.[page:0]
    </p>

    <h2>Typing and mouse use as core skills</h2>
    <p>
      Two foundational computer skills for children are typing on a keyboard and handling or clicking
      with a mouse or touchpad.[page:0]
      These skills allow the child to navigate learning platforms, write, communicate, and independently
      complete many everyday digital tasks.[page:0]
    </p>

    <h2>How computer skills support development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Literacy</strong>: Using educational software and word processors builds reading and writing skills,
        making computer literacy part of overall academic literacy.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication</strong>: For children with limited or no speech, computers and tablets can serve
        as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alternate writing</strong>: Typing offers an alternative way of written expression for children
        who find traditional handwriting difficult.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Attention</strong>: Working on a computer requires sustained attention and can strengthen
        focus and task persistence over time.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fine motor skills</strong>: Keyboard and mouse use help develop controlled finger and hand
        movements and hand–eye coordination.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensory regulation</strong>: The rhythmic feel and sound of typing can be regulating and enjoyable
        for some children with sensory needs.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Life skills</strong>: From ordering food to doing bank transactions, most daily activities now
        require basic computer or app skills.[page:0]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vocational readiness</strong>: Early comfort with typing and navigating digital tools expands
        future job and training opportunities.[page:0]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prerequisites before starting computer training</h2>
    <p>
      Before introducing a real keyboard and mouse, caregivers should check for basic readiness:
      sitting tolerance, ability to follow simple instructions, hand–eye coordination, fine and gross
      motor skills, and identification of alphabets and numbers.[page:0]
      Pre‑computer activities like using a dummy keyboard, matching letters and numbers, and
      practising up/down and right/left concepts make later computer learning smoother and less
      frustrating.[page:0]
    </p>

    <h2>About this training website</h2>
    <p>
      This website provides a structured three‑month, day‑by‑day training plan that helps caregivers
      teach typing and basic computer use to children with special needs in a gentle, stepwise manner.[page:0]
      The plan builds from pre‑computer skills to letters, favourite words, CVC words, special keys, sentences,
      and short paragraphs, with a focus on fun, consistency, and emotional safety.[page:0]
