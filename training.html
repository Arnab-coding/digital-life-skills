    <h1>Three-Month Typing & Computer Skills Training Plan</h1>
    <p class="credit">Created by Dr. Arnab Chaudhuri</p>

    <div class="note">
      This is a three‑month course with 5 sessions per week (about 60 sessions in total). Each session can be 10–20 minutes, kept light and enjoyable. 
    </div>

    <h2>Overall structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Month 1</strong>: Readiness, pre‑computer skills, and random letter/number typing.  </li>
      <li><strong>Month 2</strong>: Name, favourite words, CVC words, and spacebar/Enter.  </li>
      <li><strong>Month 3</strong>: Sentences, paragraphs, basic formatting, mouse use, and functional practice.  </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Month 1 -->
    <h2>Month 1 (Weeks 1–4): Readiness and Letter Typing</h2>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 1 (Days 1–5): Prerequisites & Pre‑Computer Skills</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 1: Practise comfortable sitting at a table for 5–10 minutes, with a dummy or printed keyboard, allowing exploration and touching keys.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 2: Work on following 1–2 step instructions like “Touch A”, “Find 3” using the dummy keyboard, with clear verbal and visual prompts.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 3: Play alphabet identification games away from the computer (flashcards, alphabet chart) focusing on capital letters A–Z.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 4: Play number identification games (0–9); reinforce up/down and right/left through simple body movements and pointing games.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 5: Match letter and number cards to positions on the dummy keyboard, building hand–eye coordination and random tracking of symbols.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 2 (Days 6–10): Transition to Real Keyboard</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 6: Introduce the real keyboard; let the child explore keypresses with supervision, emphasising pressing one key at a time.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 7: Choose 3–5 easy letters (e.g., A, B, C, D, E); show flashcard → child finds and presses that letter; use praise or tokens.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 8: Add 2 more letters; practise all 5–7 letters in random order, keeping the pace slow and non‑stressful.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 9: Turn it into a “typing game”: you say a letter, the child finds and presses it; end after a few successful trials.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 10: Review the same set of letters, noticing which letters need extra practice, and repeat in playful cycles.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 3 (Days 11–15): Building Random Alphabet Typing</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 11: Expand to 8–10 letters; practise typing one letter at a time in random order, showing the letter on a card or screen.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 12: Open a simple blank document so the child can see letters appearing on screen when they type.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 13: Mix all known letters; ask for 5–10 letters per session, focusing on accuracy and calm behaviour rather than speed.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 14: If ready, introduce a few lower‑case versions of known letters; otherwise continue with capitals only.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 15: Briefly show upper vs lower case pairs (A/a, B/b) using large print or cards, connecting them to the same key on the keyboard.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 4 (Days 16–20): Consolidation and Numbers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 16: Review all known letters with a “letter hunt” game on the keyboard (e.g., “Find H”, “Find S”).  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 17: Introduce 0–4 number keys; ask the child to type simple sequences such as 1‑2‑3.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 18: Introduce 5–9 number keys; practise identifying and typing them in order and randomly.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 19: Alternate short sets of letter typing and number typing within one session to promote flexibility.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 20: Combine: type short random sequences with both letters and numbers (e.g., A–3–B–2), ending with an easy, successful trial.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

        </li>
        <li>
          Day 28: Encourage more independent attempts at favourite words by waiting longer before prompting.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 29: Mix name and favourite words in one session (NAME → MOM → NAME → BALL), giving frequent breaks and positive feedback.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 30: Create a small “My words” document where the child types their name and favourite words as a word list.

      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 7 (Days 31–35): CVC and Short Words</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 31: Introduce very short CVC or high‑frequency words like IN, IS, UP, CAT, DOG, MAT, using picture cards when available.  
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Day 37: Practise typing one short word, then pressing spacebar, using modelling and verbal prompts.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 38: Continue word + spacebar practice, gradually fading prompts as the child anticipates the space after each word.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 39: Practise typing a word, then pressing Enter to move to a new line; show visually what happens on screen.  
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Day 50: Revisit one of the earlier paragraphs to consolidate learning and improve fluency.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="week-block">
      <h3>Week 12 (Days 56–60): Functional Practice & Generalisation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Day 56: Create a simple daily routine list (e.g., “Wake up”, “Brush teeth”) that the child types and decorates with basic formatting.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Day 59: Review the three‑month journey: retype name, favourite words, and one short paragraph, noticing how much easier it feels now.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Day 60: Combine skills in a celebration session: type name, one favourite word, one sentence, and one short paragraph, apply a simple formatting change, and praise the child with family present.  
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Caregiver tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep sessions predictable: same time, same place, and a short, clear routine (greet, practise, praise, close).  
      </li>
      <li>
        Use high‑interest words and topics so that typing feels meaningful, not just mechanical drill.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Watch for signs of overload (restlessness, frustration, withdrawal) and stop early rather than forcing completion.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequently celebrate small achievements with verbal praise, tokens, or preferred activities, supporting motivation and self‑confidence.  
      </li>
    </ul>
